# Reporting Security Issues

libNeoAppleArchive is meant for public use of the `.aar`/`.yaa` (and soon, `.aea`) file formats, and is not meant to be an entrypoint for bad actors. I appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/0xilis/libNeoAppleArchive/security/advisories/new) tab.

I will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, I will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.
